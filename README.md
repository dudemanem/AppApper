Welcome to the AppApper

This app is being created with one thing in mind: desktop clutter sucks. I struggle with it, you probably do, heck lots of people do! But no more! AppApper is a Windows application made with Python that allows you to create shortcuts for files and apps. Now you only need one app to launch up to fifteen shortcuts at a time! 

This is a project I am working on for my final project in my intro to IT class. It is my first ever attempt at making an app in python, so I am aware that there are bugs and the UI isn't great. That being said, the app does work as intended, and I hope it can be useful for some people!
